/**
 * Facilitates fetching a query given its variables and an environment, while
 * retaining data for the query and de-duping identical requests that are
 * _in-flight_.
 *
 * Observing a request:
 * ====================
 * fetchQuery_UNSTABLE takes an Observer which you can use to observe network
 * responses and other events like errors or when the request is complete:
 *
 * ```
 * fetchQuery_UNSTABLE(environment, query, variables, {
 *   // Called when network requests starts
 *   start: (subsctiption) => {},
 *
 *   // Called after a payload is received and written to the local store
 *   next: (payload) => {},
 *
 *   // Called when network requests errors
 *   error: (error) => {},
 *
 *   // Called when network requests fully completes
 *   complete: () => {},
 *
 *   // Called when network request is unsubscribed
 *   unsubscribe: (subscription) => {},
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * In-flight request de-duping:
 * ============================
 * By default, calling fetchQuery_UNSTABLE multiple times with the same
 * environment, query and variables will not initiate a new request if a request
 * for those same parameters is already in flight.
 *
 * A request is marked in-flight from the moment it starts until the moment it
 * fully completes, regardless of error or successful completion.
 *
 * NOTE: If the request completes _synchronously_, calling fetchQuery_UNSTABLE
 * a second time with the same arguments in the same tick will _NOT_ de-dupe
 * the request given that it will no longer be in-flight.
 *
 *
 * Data Retention:
 * ===============
 * This function will _retain_ data for the given query and variables on the
 * provided Relay environment; this means that it prevent that data from being
 * garbage collected (i.e. deleted) from the Relay store.
 * In order to release the data, the will return a Disposable which can be used to
 * dispose of the retained data:
 *
 * ```
 * const disposable = fetchQuery_UNSTABLE(...);
 *
 * // After calling this, the data might be garbage collected (i.e. deleted)
 * // from the Relay local store
 * disposable.dispose();
 * ```
